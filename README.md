An easy-to-setup bot that helps you to communicate with your meetup attendees.

With the carousel consisting of talks, it allows the users:
- receive detailed description of a talk
- rate a talk
- ask the speaker questions

The interface is currently in Russian (see [#101](https://github.com/Stark-Mountain/meetup-facebook-bot/issues/101))

# How to use

Once you've set the bot up (see below), just go to `https://(yourdomain)/login` and fill out the Speaker and Talk tables. (Ignore the `token` field of Speaker table).

# How to setup
Prerequisites: a computer with Ubuntu 16.04 and an associated domain name; registered [Facebook app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/guides/setup).

1. Get the code: `git clone https://github.com/Stark-Mountain/meetup-facebook-bot && cd meetup-facebook-bot`.
2. Put the address of Ubuntu 16.04 computer [here](https://github.com/Stark-Mountain/meetup-facebook-bot/blob/master/fabfile.py#L9).
3. You may want to activate virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`.
4. Install deployment dependencies: `pip install -r requirements-deploy.txt`.
5. Run `fab bootstrap` and follow further instructions. This will install and configure uWSGI with nginx; acquire SSL certificate for your domain and setup an automatic renewal.
6. Go to your domain and make sure everything's working.

# How to run tests
After all dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`), run the following command from the root folder of the project:

`$ python3 -m pytest tests`
